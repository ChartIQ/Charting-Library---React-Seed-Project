## Contributing

If you see something that you think this project needs, feel free to submit a rull request. This project follows the GitFlow branching strategy, if you're not familiar with it you can read about it [here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [here](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/).

First fork the project, checkout branch `develop` and work from there. Once you have tested that your projects works submit a Pull Request and we will review your work, asking for changes if necessary. Once the work has been approved we'll merge it into a release branch where it will be merged into master.
